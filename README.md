# Cosmos Hub Mainnet

## Overview

The current Gaia Version of the Cosmos Hub mainnet is [`v13.0.0`](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v13.0.0). To bootstrap a mainnet node, it is possible to sync from `v12.0.0` via Quicksync or via [State Sync](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/join-mainnet.html#state-sync).

For a full set of instructions on boostrapping a mainnet node, see the Hub's [**Join the Cosmos Hub Mainnet**](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/join-mainnet.html) documentation.

## 🗓️ Scheduled Upgrade

The `v13` upgrade was proposed through an [on-chain software upgrade proposal](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/825) and is open to voting between 2023-09-22 and 2023-10-06. The upgrade is proposed to take place at block height **17,380,000** which should occur approximately at **October 11th 2023.** The chain id will remain `cosmoshub-4`.

You can find `v13.0.0` tagged code and binaries in the [gaia repository](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v13.0.0).
Upgrades can be a memory intensive process. Please see the guide for the [current hardware recommendations](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/join-mainnet.html#hardware). We recommend that you are prepared to upgrade on a machine with sufficient physical memory. Some node operators also choose add 8-16 GB of swap to avoid out of memory issues.

You can check out the Cosmos Hub documentation for a step-by-step tutorial on how to [upgrade your node](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/upgrade-node.html). Version specific upgrade notes using Cosmovisor are provided below.

### Upgrading using Cosmovisor

Cosmovisor instructions can be found in the [v13 upgrade instructions](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/migration/cosmoshub-4-v13-upgrade.md).

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools preinstalled:

- `make` & `gcc`
- `Go 1.20.x+`

> **Note**: See the [installation docs](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/getting-started/installation.html) for clarification and a detailed set of instructions.

### Quicksync

Quicksync.io offers several daily snapshots of the Cosmos Hub with varying levels of pruning (archive 1.4TB, default 540GB, and pruned 265GB). For downloads and installation instructions, visit the [Cosmos Quicksync guide](https://quicksync.io/networks/cosmos.html).

### State Sync

To enable state sync, visit an [explorer](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/blocks) to get a recent block height and corresponding hash. A node operator can choose any height/hash in the current bonding period, but as the recommended snapshot period is 1000 blocks, it is advised to choose something close to current height - 1000. Set these parameters in the code snippet below `<BLOCK_HEIGHT>` and `<BLOCK_HASH>`

For reference, the list of `rpc_servers` and `persistent` peers can be found in the [cosmos hub chain-registry repo](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/cosmoshub/chain.json).

> _NOTE_:  If the node is unable to connect to any of the seeds listed here, find additional seeds and peers in [this document](https://hackmd.io/@KFEZk8oMTz6vBlwADz0M4A/BkKEUOsZu#) maintained by community members, which is automatically generated by crawling the network. Additionally, node operators can just copy [Quicksync's addressbook](https://quicksync.io/addrbook.cosmos.json) and move it to `$HOME/.gaia/config/addrbook.json`

## Upgrade to Validator Node

You now have an active full node. What's the next step? You can upgrade your full node to become a Cosmos Validator. The top 180 validators have the ability to propose new blocks to the Cosmos Hub. Continue onto [the Validator Setup](../validators/validator-setup.md).
